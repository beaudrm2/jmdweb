// Optional video: set `video` to an MP4 (H.264) in assets/video/, optionally

        ["The short version", "Jax Max Delta has <strong>no user accounts</strong> and asks you for <strong>no personal information</strong>. Your telemetry, lap data, session history and car setups are stored <strong>on your device</strong>. We do not sell, rent or share your data, and we do not use it for advertising. Three things leave your device: <strong>crash diagnostics</strong>, <strong>purchase transactions</strong>, and — only if your device has iCloud available — a <strong>backup of your session history into your own private iCloud container</strong>, which we cannot read. You can delete everything at any time from inside the app, or by deleting the app."],
        ["What the app receives from your game", "Jax Max Delta listens on your local network for the UDP telemetry your F1 game broadcasts (EA F1 24, F1 25 and F1 26). That traffic travels only across your own network, from your console or PC to your phone. It is received by the app and never sent onward by it. It contains race data — lap times, speed, tyre state, positions, the names the game assigns to drivers in your session — and no information about you personally. The app does not transmit telemetry to us or to anyone else."],
        ["What is stored on your device", "The following stay in the app's private storage on your device: session history (tracks, session types, lap and sector times, positions, results, events, penalties, weather); lap traces (throttle, brake, steering, speed, gear, ERS, DRS samples); car setups captured from your sessions and your ratings of them; and your app preferences (connection host and port, game selection, language, units, Jax voice and coaching settings, data-retention setting). You control how long the heavier data is kept through <strong>Settings → SUPPORT</strong> (data capture and retention), and you can delete individual sessions or all of them at any time."],

When you subscribe or restore a purchase, Apple and RevenueCat process the transaction and an anonymous app-installation identifier so the app knows whether your subscription is active.

See <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy\">Firebase privacy information</a>."],

This is a shipped feature, so this policy states it plainly. The backup contains session records and leagues; it does <strong>not</strong> contain lap-trace or race-data files, which remain only on the device that captured them. The container belongs to your Apple Account and Apple provides the storage — <strong>we have no access to it</strong>, and we cannot read, list or recover your backups. The app keeps the most recent backup plus up to five dated copies and prunes older ones. Before restoring, the app writes a local safety copy on your device so a restore can be undone, and restoring never overwrites a session already on the device. To remove these backups, delete the app's data from iCloud in iOS Settings, or delete the app. Apple's handling of iCloud data is governed by Apple's privacy policy."],

No cross-app or cross-site tracking, and no App Tracking Transparency prompt, because we do not track. No product analytics or behavioural telemetry sent to us.

We do not process special categories of data and we do not carry out automated decision-making that produces legal effects."],
        ["Retention", "Data on your device is kept until you delete it, either by deleting sessions in the app, letting your retention setting prune trace data, or deleting the app. iCloud backups are kept in your own container until you delete them; the app itself keeps the latest plus five dated copies.

If you are in the EEA or UK you also have the right to complain to your data-protection authority.
